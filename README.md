# Employee Tracker

## Description

The Employee Tracker is a command-line application built to help businesses manage their employee database. 

- The motivation for this project was to create a simple and efficient way for businesses to keep track of their employees, roles, and departments.
- This project was built to provide a solution for businesses that need a straightforward, easy-to-use tool for managing their employee data.
- The problem it solves is the often complex and time-consuming task of managing employee data.
- Through this project, I learned more about MySQL, Inquirer, and Node.js, and how they can be used together to create powerful, data-driven applications.
